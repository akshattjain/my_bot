This repository contains the code for controlling a crawler bot using ROS (Robot Operating System). The project demonstrates how to integrate ROS for seamless control and coordination of a crawler bot, enabling advanced robotic functionalities. It also includes simulation and visualization tools such as Gazebo and RViz for mapping and testing.

Features
ROS Integration: Leverages ROS for modular and scalable robotic control.
Crawler Control: Precise movement and navigation of a crawler bot.
Sensor Integration: Supports various sensors for enhanced environment interaction.
Gazebo Simulation: Test and simulate the crawler bot in a virtual environment.
RViz Visualization: Visualize the bot's movements and sensor data in real-time.
Extensibility: Easily extendable to add more features or integrate with other ROS packages.
